            <b><u>Pairing</u></b>: I feel that peer-pairing is a great strategy; it is good to have a designated driver and navigator as challenges become far more efficient using this type of system. One person can do the researching and checking of syntax while the other is doing actual code all whilst simultaneously conversing and switching roles when needed. I felt that I was able to learn my partner's style of coding much quicker than having read any text and upon doing several peer-pairing sessions, realizing all of the different ways of achieving the same goal is quite impressive! One thing I must say that is a complete must is to 1.) Be vocal -if you have an issue AT ALL, mention it. The more your pair knows about you and your situation, the easier it is for the pair to undertsand one another; with that said, set a guideline for time requirements and when to switch roles. 2.) ALWAYS use headphones, nothing like getting screeching noise and/or your own voice's feedback, back to you.

            <b><u>Feedback</u></b>: The majority of my feedback is as I had expected. My pair's felt I was an asset to the team, bring good suggestion/ideas to the table and am easy to get along with. One thing I feel I personally need to address is my verbal syntax -which again, when learning a new language takes time to master. Now, writing feedback was almost always relatively straight-forward unless there was a specific situation which stood out like a sore-thumb; in which case, I was forced to be brutally honest in order to help my pair better themselves for future pairing.
