          <p>Commentary:</p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Today I wanted to touch on a simple software development process that effectively any software developer, (and many do) can follow. This process involves a very short cycle of: writing tests, running tests, write code to make said test(s) pass, running tests, refactoring code and repeating the process; it's called Test-Driven Developement. As the name insinuates, this process expects the user-end to develop code just effectively enough to make test(s) pass and as encourages simple design. The simple process works as so:
          <br><br><br>

          1.) Write Tests - The first step and most important as the user need full understanding of what the project is or is expected to accomplish; Psuedo-coding is a great way to 'see' what the end-goal is. After understanding, write tests which, (at this point will fail as there is no code written), will pass if the correct code is written; this may seem backwards because, well...it is, and it works.<br><br>
          2.) Run Tests - They will intially fail as no code has been written, but will give errors that need remedy next.<br><br>
          3.) Write Code - Manage to write just enough code to make a test pass.<br><br>
          4.) Run Tests - Tests may or may not fail; if they fail, remedy the situation per error(s), if they pass, move onto the next feature.<br><br>
          5.) Refactor - Now that code is written that passes self-created tests, make the code concise by refactoring just enough to a point where it's readable yet D.R.Y.<br><br>
          6.) Rinse-Repeat.<br><br>

          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This process not only works, but it does a great job in breaking down a end-goal into smaller steps that are ultimately are tested for in each stage of the process ensuring what is current is slowly moving towards a M.V.P.<br><br>
