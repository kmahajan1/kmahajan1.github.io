        What are the benefits of version control?
      </b>
      <p>
        Version control is handy when working with a team of people who are all editing, adding, changing a master (known working version) of a said app or project. The ability to revert back to an older working version when faced with a version that has bugs is critical so-as not to start from scratch.

        How does git help you keep track of changes?
      </b>
        <p> 
          Git is a version control software that resides on a local machine. Changes are tracked when files are added (git add (filename))

      <b>Why use GitHub to store your code?</b>
        <p> 
          GitHub is a great resource to 'publish' your work so others can view/edit/change your code and request 'pull' to merge these changes.
