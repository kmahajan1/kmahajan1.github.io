      What are the benefits of version control? Version control is handy when working with a team of people who are all editing, adding, changing a master (known working version) of a said app or project. The ability to revert back to an older working version when faced with a version that has bugs is critical so-as not to start from scratch.

      How does git help you keep track of changes? Git is a version control software that resides on a local machine. Changes are tracked when files are add (git add (filename))

      Why use GitHub to store your code? GitHub is a great resource to 'publish' your work so others can view/edit/change your code and request 'pull' to merge these changes.
