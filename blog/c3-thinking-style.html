          <p>Commentary:</p>
          Today's blog post I wanted to focus in on the Gregorc's Thinking Style; mine particularly said I was a Concrete Sequential style of thinker. What that means essentially is I like order and facts and dislike situations where discussion revolve around no particular point -I am systematic, if you will. With that said, I realize my experience at DBC will be extremely difficult unless I learn to accept that not everything will be in order, there will be times that things cannot be predictable and rather than to panic, I'd better start preparing myself for such said situations. How? you may ask? Well I plan on peer-pairing more often so I can get used to things not working in the way *I* intend on always -exposing myself to others' ideas more rather than single-handidly relying on mine alone.
           <p><b>Growth vs. Fixed Mindset</b>: The best way I can put it is do you have the personality/mindset which will put up a guard/ego and avoid foreign situations? Or do you have the mindset where you're up for challenges with a positive outlook determined to accomplish a set goal? I've always looked at myself as a very positive person -despite some very negative situations I've faced in my life. Being open, honest, accetping of constructive criticism, and seeking help when help is needed are all qualities that allow for intelligence to expand. <p/>
          <p><b>Reflection</b>:
            So tomorrow marks my 4th week in Phase 0 at Dev BootCamp -wow, has it really been that long?!? Time really flew and the amount of information that has entered my brain and hasn't ooozed out of my ears is plentiful, almost unbelieveable given the short-time frame in which it was shoved in. I've learned a lot about shortcuts (not only for the command line/Sublime) but also for methods and how to go about solving the same problem with much fewer lines of code. A problem that I faced was regarding the aforementioned information leak from my brain; there were instances where I completely blanked on simple code as I thought far too deep about it and made it more complicated than it needed to be. It was then when I had realized that repetition is really the only way all of this information will stick -and even then, using resources was going to become a regular task.</p>
