          <p>Commentary:</p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Today I wanted to speak a little about myself and a value that helps drive my urge to become a better husband/son/brother/friend/colleague and person -in the general sense of the word. Our lives are constantly filled with a variety of influence(s) whether they come from the media, family, friends, co-workers, acquaintences, etc., and it is easy to succomb to these pressures; in doing such can very easily better/worsen our personalities and being as a whole.
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In order to combat negative influences, for the past few years something that I find myself often trying to expand is my personal self-growth. It's a value that I cherish as it comes strictly from within; no outside influence can force/deter my choice to better myself -regardless of the situation, it's solely in my control. I feel that if we don't grow daily in some shape or form and remain 'status quo' that we're just wasting time and occupying valuable space -even the littlest of things, a flower, (which compared to humans is far less complex) grows regularly. Whether it be learning a new skill or bettering a weaker trait, it's essential to learn from our surroundings and as such, each day I try to do something that I can look back at and say, "I've grown"; the sense of accomplishment from knowing that you made an impact and invested in something that will last a lifetime, (yourself) is undeiably the most important investment one can make. Having said that, one of my greatest traits is my intuitiveness and positivity. I often find myself hearing from others how positive I am in negative situations. I believe strongly in Karma and the Law of Attraction; with seeking positivity, positive notions will naturally gravitate towards oneself. Because the same can be said about negativity, it's better to make the best of the worse-case-scenario with sights on the brighter side of things.

          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Interestingly enough, these ambitious traits and positive notions have GREATLY impacted my current role as a student at Dev BootCamp. During Phase 0, (which is quickly wrapping up off-site in a little over two weeks) there had been two specific times, (mid-way through week 5 and week 6) where I began to doubt my abilities as a developer. I kept my spirits as high as I possibly could and sourced all of my energy to ensure that I keep up with the rigourous regimen and learning style. Looking back, I pat myself on the back for knowing that though I was faced with intense difficulty that I was able to keep on trucking and as such, not only am I closer to my end-goal of becoming a Junior Web Developer, but the material I had such difficulty with comes to me much easier! ...Moral of the story? Keep your head up and stay positive regardless of your situation and the universe will work wonders!
