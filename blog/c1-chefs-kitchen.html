        What's your take on the DBC experience?
      </b>
      <p>
        I love the idea of immersive learning. With the resources and the background knowledge given during Phase 0 to jumpstart the learning process and be ready for Phase 1 is grueling, but strangely enough, kiiiinda fun!

        What is your impression of DBC?
      </b>
        <p> 
          I look at DevBootCamp as a hacker's playground. To me coding is a very unique trait that allows one to see inner on-goings of what makes computers, apps, programs TICK. I feel like I am apart of a niche group of similiar-minded individuals craving knowledge.

      <b>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
      </b>
        <p> 
          I think the culture is actually what drew me into the specific 'coding academy'. There's something about being thrown in a pool of sharks, (with the prepardness taught during Phase 0) being able to fend off predators -it's exciting.
        </p>

      <p> 
        <b>Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how?
        </b>
          <p> 
            After my first offical week during Phase 0, my expectations have definitely changed. I am moreso now realizing this will take a great deal of effort. I've spent well over the estimated 15-25 hrs needed for Phase 0 and this is just week 1 of Phase 0!
          </p>

      <p> 
        <b>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
        </b>
          <p> 
            The learning curve and curriculum are definitely a bit nerve-wrecking seeing as how much information is thrown at me already. The thing that worries me the most is the ability to RETAIN this valuable information. I suppose repetition will help alleviate this nerovousness over time.
