        <b><u>Where am I from</u></b>: I am originally born and raised in Chicago, IL. I spent the first five years of my life in the city before moving to a suburb right outside of Chicago called Niles, IL where I spent most of my childhood and up until highschool there. In 1997, to begin my freshman year of highschool my family and I moved further northwest to a suburb of Chicago called Roselle, IL where I finished highschool and have spent most of my life residing -albeit some short spurts in Surprise, AZ and Milwaukee, WI in 2005 and 2014, respectively where I moved out on my own.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b><u>Interest(s) & Hobbies</u></b>: My interests and hobbies tend to change relatively quickly as there is so much to learn surrounding us on a daily basis. The few things that I can say have always stuck were: cars, technology, and gentleman's style. I feel these are interests that will never fade from my persona and will be with me til the end of time.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b><u>Educational Experience</u></b>: I am a so-called 'Jack-of-all-Trades'. I currently hold my Loan Originator license, (legally can 'sell' loans for prospective home-buyers), work for Samsung Telecomunications as a product consultant, and am a certified Auto Technician with a concentration in Electronic Engine Calibration. I currently am using my Engine Calibrator license to operate my business where I contract with a handful of auto shops that affix superchargers, turbochargers, nitrous oxide, etc., and once they're through performing the mechanical work, I go in to make horsepower whilst retaining fuel consumption, (often times increasing it), and driveability/reliability :). **For more detailed information regarding my education/experience as well as skillsets, please click the link below!

        <b><u>Quirks</u></b>: Everybody has them, and I am no exception to that rule. If I had to choose my biggest 'quirk' it'd definitely have to be the fact that I NEED to be neat and organized; whether it's the hierarchy of files on my computers/smartphone, matching my daily outfit(s), down to my bedroom closet, (needing to arrange by colors and seasons). I feel it's to the point of almost being clinically deemed with Obssessive Compulsive Disorder, (OCD) :laughs:
